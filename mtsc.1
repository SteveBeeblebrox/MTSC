.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
mtsc [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT]
.SS "FLAGS:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints help information
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-html\fR
Treat the input as an HTML file and transpile any script tags with the type attribute set to
\&'text/typescript', 'application/typescript', 'tsmodule', or 'module/typescript'
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-minify\fR
Enables minification using Terser (both compression and mangling) of output code; except for
HTML files, '.min' is prepend to the output file extension (Currently ignored if parsing HTML)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR
Treat the input as a modern ES module (Enabled by default for .mts files and HTML script tags
with type 'tsmodule' or 'module/typescript')
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preprocessor\fR
Enables comment preprocessor (looks for directives within single\-line triple\-slash comments,
e.g. '///#define')
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints version information
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Prints verbose error messages
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-define\fR <MACROS>...
Define macros using the form 'MACRO(x)=definition' (Unused if preprocessor is
not enabled)
.TP
\fB\-I\fR <PATH>...
Add additional include search paths (Unused if preprocessor is not enabled)
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-jsx\fR <JSX\-FACTORY>
Sets the JSX factory for compiled code (When this option is set but blank or
when the file extension is .tsx, JSX is preserved as is; otherwise, it is
interpreted as standard code)
.TP
\fB\-\-jsx\-fragment\fR <JSX\-FRAGMENT>
Sets the JSX fragment factory for compiled code (Requires the jsx option to be
set as well) [default: null]
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR <NAME>
Sets the file name and extension when not available via the main arg (Such as
reading from stdin or file descriptors)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-out\fR <OUTPUT>
Sets the output file to write transpiled code to instead of using the input
file's name with the extension changed to .js or .html in the case of HTML
files (When set to '\-' or set but blank, output is written to stdout; if set to
a directory and an input file is provided, the output file will be written to
the given directory with the extension changed to .js/.html)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\fR <ES\-VERSION>
Sets the JavaScript language and library version for compiled code [default:
esnext]
