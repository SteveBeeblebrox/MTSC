.SH NAME
MTSC \- manual page for MTSC 5.5.3
.SH DESCRIPTION
MTSC 5.5.3
Trin Wasinger
A standalone TypeScript compiler with support for JSX, HTML script tags, preprocessing, and minification
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
mtsc [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT]
.SS "FLAGS:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints help information
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-html\fR
Treat the input as an HTML file and transpile any script tags with the type attribute set to
\&'text/typescript' or 'tsmodule' (Enabled by default for '.html' files)
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-minify\fR
Enables minification using Terser (both compression and mangling) of output code (Except for
HTML files, '.min' is prepend to the output file extension)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-module\fR
Treat the input as a modern ES module (Enabled by default for '.mts' files and HTML script
tags with type 'tsmodule')
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preprocessor\fR
Enables comment preprocessor (Looks for directives within single\-line triple\-slash comments,
e.g. '///#define'; enabled by default for '.p.*' files)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints version information
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Prints verbose error messages
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-define\fR <MACRO>...
Define macros using the form 'MACRO(x)=definition' (Unused if preprocessor is
not enabled)
.TP
\fB\-I\fR <PATH>...
Add additional include search paths (Unused if preprocessor is not enabled)
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-jsx\fR <JSX\-FACTORY>
Sets the JSX factory for compiled code (When this option is set but blank or
when the file extension is '.tsx', JSX is preserved as is; otherwise, it is
interpreted as standard code)
.TP
\fB\-\-jsx\-fragment\fR <JSX\-FRAGMENT>
Sets the JSX fragment factory for compiled code (Requires the jsx option to be
set as well) [default: null]
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR <NAME>
Sets the file name and extension when not available via the main arg (Such as
reading from stdin or file descriptors; this can be used by the preprocessor
and to infer other options)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-out\fR <PATH>
Sets the output file to write transpiled code to instead of using the input
file's name with the extension updated (When set to '\-' or set but blank,
output is written to stdout; if set to a directory and an input file is
provided, the output file will be written to the given directory with the
extension updated)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\fR <ES\-VERSION>
Sets the JavaScript language and library version for compiled code [default:
esnext]
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT>
Sets the input file to compile (Leave blank or set to '\-' to read from stdin)
